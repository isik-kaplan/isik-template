## Before you start

This app is **not servable at plain `localhost`** - cross-subdomain session/CSRF cookies (shared
across `api.`, `admin.`, `auth.{{ cookiecutter.domain }}`) need a real registrable domain. Add to
`/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 api.{{ cookiecutter.domain }} admin.{{ cookiecutter.domain }} auth.{{ cookiecutter.domain }}
```

or point real DNS at these subdomains if deploying to the real domain instead.

## Running it

```
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

Split rather than `up -d --build` in one shot: `worker`/`scheduler` share `backend`'s image tag
with no `build:` of their own, and starting them before that build finishes tagging the image can
race compose into trying to pull it instead of using what was just built.

Brings up `database`, `broker`, `backend`, `worker`, `scheduler`, `frontend`, and `server` (nginx,
the only service publishing a host port). Visit `http://{{ cookiecutter.domain }}`. `.env` was
already created for you at generation time (from `.env.example`) - see that file's own header
comment before changing anything in it.

## Testing

```
docker compose run --rm --no-deps backend python -m pytest   # backend, 100% coverage required
cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}-frontend && npm install && npm run lint && npm run test
cd e2e && docker compose build && docker compose up -d && docker compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test
```

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs all three on every push/PR.
